Given the topics you've covered, I suggest building a **"Personal Expense Tracker"**. This project will allow you to apply many of the concepts you've learned in a real-world context.

### **Personal Expense Tracker**:

#### **Features**:

1. **Add an Expense**:

   - Description of the expense.
   - Amount spent.
   - Date of the expense.
   - Category of the expense (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment).

2. **View All Expenses**:

   - Display a list of all expenses.
   - Each expense item should show the description, amount, date, and category.

3. **Filter Expenses**:

   - By date range.
   - By category.

4. **Calculate Total Expenses**:

   - Display the total amount spent.
   - Display the total amount spent per category.

5. **Delete an Expense**:
   - Option to remove an expense from the list.

#### **How the Topics You've Learned Apply**:

- **Variables**: Use `var`, `let`, and `const` to store data like expenses, total amount, etc.
- **String Methods & Template Strings**: Display expenses, format data, and create dynamic messages.
- **Data Types**: Understand the difference between `null`, `undefined`, and other data types. Use `BigInt` for large amounts if necessary.
- **Control Structures**: Use `if-else`, `switch`, and ternary operators to handle different conditions, like filtering expenses.
- **Loops**: Use loops like `for`, `while`, and `do-while` to iterate through the list of expenses, calculate totals, etc.
- **Arrays**: Store the list of expenses in an array. Use methods like `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift` to manage the list.
- **Objects**: Represent each expense as an object with properties like description, amount, date, and category. Use dot and bracket notation to access and modify properties.
- **Functions**: Create functions for adding expenses, calculating totals, filtering expenses, etc. Explore higher-order functions, callbacks, and functions returning functions for advanced features.

#### **Steps to Build**:

1. **Design the UI**: Create a simple HTML layout with input fields for adding expenses and buttons for actions.

2. **Initialize Data Structures**: Set up arrays and objects to store the list of expenses and other necessary data.

3. **Implement Features**: Start with the 'Add an Expense' feature, then move on to 'View', 'Filter', 'Calculate', and 'Delete'.

4. **Test**: After implementing each feature, test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

5. **Refactor**: Review your code to see if there are areas to improve, optimize, or simplify.

6. **Enhancements**: Once the basic features are in place, think of additional features or improvements. For example, you could add a feature to edit an expense or visualize expenses using charts.

Building this project will not only help you apply the concepts you've learned but also enhance your problem-solving skills and logical thinking. Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks and tackle each one step by step. Good luck, and happy coding!
